suite-1.conf
suite-2.conf
============
These are my test map config files that exercise a fair bit of the
functionality of Weathermap, in a couple of files. The first one
is mostly NODE stuff, and the second is mostly LINK stuff. As such,
they make quite useful demo maps, I guess. suite-1.png and suite-2.png
show what these maps *should* look like. They use quite a few fonts
that I can't supply, but mostly they use Bitstream Vera, which is in
the docs/example directory.

map-split.php
=============

Reads in a map, then writes out 'submaps' of a certain size. Edit the
top of the script to specify the source map, and the required size of
the new maps, and it will chop up your map for you. It doesn't do 
anything clever with things like KEYPOS or TITLEPOS, but it will do
NODEs OK. It'll delete any links where only one end is in the final
map, so cross-sheet links will need to be put back in. It also removes
the BACKGROUND image if there is one, since it will (by definition) be
the wrong size for the new maps.

auto-overlib.pl
===============

A small but useful script that takes a weathermap config file with 
references to Cacti RRD targets and automatically adds in all the 
INFOURL and OVERLIBGRAPH lines it can, where they don't exist. 

You'll need to edit the script to allow it to log in to your Cacti 
database. Requires the Perl DBI and DBD::mysql modules. 

Should work with both PHP and perl versions, but not tested with PHP 
one.
