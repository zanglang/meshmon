0.92 - FIXED weathermap CLI help said --random-data instead of --randomdata
       FIXED one last php short_tag in poller_common.php - thanks Bernado Diez
       FIXED a SET in DEFAULT node/link is inherited by all node/links now.
       FIXED changing defaults in the editor changes existing objects that use the default value
       FIXED unreadable files in the configs/ directory don't kill the editor file-picker anymore
       FIXED - weathermap.conf really *is* a simple map again. My test version went out with 0.9 and 0.91
       INTERNAL added a lot more memory debug points in
       INTERNAL refactored the curve/link drawing code to make some new features possible/easier
       Further tweaks and improvements to check.php (Basic GD check, memory_limit check, PEAR Getopt check, and more explanation now)
       Small improvements to the editor's font-picking, including samples of all fonts.
       Added - Editor handles VIAs in a MUCH better way when moving nodes.
       Improved clipping reporting, improved plugin loading (Niels Baggesen)
       Added - BWSTYLE lets you choose between regular and angled bwlabels
               angled bwlabels follow the angle of the link arrow, which can save space.
       Added - Editor can pick Cacti graphs for NODE's overlib/infourl (but NOT targets)
       Added - COMMENTPOS allows you to move the position of comments along the link (like BWLABELPOS)
       FIXED - strange edge case with gradient SCALE caused div-by-zero (Tiago Giorgetti)
       CHANGE - The editor doesn't *require* an editor-config.php anymore. It *will* warn you if the defaults aren't enough, however.
       
0.91 - FIXED RRD bug with '-' DS names. This was fixed in 0.9pre3, but somehow slipped through.
       FIXED KILO bug again (Steve Woodcock)
       FIXED handling of MRTG html files on remote systems
       FIXED ReadConfig doesn't complain about KEYPOS DEFAULT -1 -1 (as written by WriteConfig) anymore
       FIXED NOTES was not fully tested, and broke cactihost: targets, at least.
       FIXED BWLABELPOS wasn't handled properly by the editor/WriteConfig (it would swap the positions over)
	FIXED Documentation fixes for installation (to include check.php) and NODE TARGETs.
       NEW check.php checks for presence of possibly-missing functions in your PHP installation
       NEW 'quiet' logging setting for Cacti plugin - in LOW logging, only errors are logged.
       NEW add a - to the front of a targetspec and you can take away values instead of aggregating them (think Total-VPN=Internet, for example)
       NEW the scale line that was 'hit' for each link direction is stored in inscalekey and outscalekey

0.9  - Changed node rendering - now we render to a transparent mini-image and blit them on. This will be good for the editor.
	FIXED long-undetected bug in HTML_ImageMap for similarly named nodes or links (SLander)
	   Added BWLABELPOS - you can specify the position of the bandwidth labels along the link
       Added OVERLIBCAPTION based on code from Jared Gillis
	   Moved all ReadData code into plugins to allow for user-supplied data sources
	   FIXED unreported bug where WriteConfig throws away floating point part of SCALEs
	  FIXED another variation of the imagemap sorting bug from 0.81 (Erik van Cutsem)
	FIXED KILO ignored bug (found/patch by Steve Woodcock)
	   FIXED unreported bug where WriteConfig throws away HTMLOUTPUTFILE and IMAGEOUTPUTFILE 
	   Added facility to use multiple SCALEs in a map. SCALE takes an optional name. NODEs and LINKs can have a USESCALE line.
	   FIXED bugs relating to assumption that 'admin' user always exists, and that users never go away, in the Cacti mgmt tab (adrian marsh)
	   Logging is tidied up a bit under Cacti's poller
	   FIXED Added a warning for RRD data sources where the DS names you specify don't exist in the RRD file
	   Added numeric offsets for NODES lines, like for LABELOFFSET. Move the end of a link whereever you like.
	   Added a new 'static' datasource - you can hardcode values, if you ever needed to.
	   Added a 'gauge:' datasource to the rrd plugin. Allows you to use values from any rrd without bit/byte-conversion.
	   Added formatting tokens into most strings - you can print data on the map from various places, including stuff
	      placed there by plugins.
	   Added - if you specify an output filename ending in .jpg or .gif, you'll get a GIF or JPEG file.
	   Added - BACKGROUND and ICON also understand JPEG, GIF and PNG, if your GD library understands them.
	   Added - support for non-standard polling periods in Cacti plugin. You can choose to only update every so often, or not at all (manually).
	   Added - manual 'recalculate now' button in Cacti plugin's management UI
	   Added - SET command to pass hints into plugins or weathermap core, per-node, per-link or globally.
	   Cleaned up config parser. Can be more fussy. More consistent though.
	   Added - CLI tool takes --define to define SET-style variables
	   
0.82   FIXED another variation on ReadFromRRD not detecting NaNs properly (hyland)
       FIXED SQL error which affects only some MySQL 5s (gundamx)
       FIXED some minor php errors in setup.php (cigamit)
       Changed the rrdtool period from now-400 to now-800 to avoid long-poller-cycle problems.
       Did some more /=>DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR changes - there weren't any problems, but it's a potential one.
       FIXED if you use the editor and your rrdtool is somewhere other than /usr/bin/rrdtool then you get an incorrect error about checking line 27 of the CLI tool.
	   
0.81 - Added a Weathermaps link to the Cacti 'Configuration' side-menu. Removed 'Manage Maps' link in Weathermap tab. (knobdy)
       File-picker in editor no longer masks on *.conf
	   FIXED sort-order bug for imagemaps (Fran Boon)
	   FIXED plugin shows same map twice if you have 'Anyone + users' (Fran Boon, again)
	   FIXED default bandwidth duplicated field in editor. (qjy2000_cn)
	   FIXED now allow TITLEPOS 0 0 (actually, y=0 is useless, but x=0 might be useful) (knobdy)
	   Editor still won't upload images, but it WILL let you pick from any PNG files in the images/
	     folder, and any images already mentioned in the map configuration file for ICON and BACKGROUND 
		 lines. (everyone and their dog)
	   Similar change for DEFINEFONT. You still have to hand-edit to define the font, but after that, the 
	     editor will let you pick it.
	   Changed the dependency tests to NOT give a warning about particular DLL names.
	   Added more dependency tests for specific functions.
	   Changes some debug messages to warning, so that they are visible in the logs even without DEBUG on.
	   FIXED minor (unreported) bug with sort order in Manage Maps
	   Changed most Cacti Plugin code to use Cacti's (logging) SQL functions. Hopefully this will help
	     with running down a couple of problems for Windows users.
	   More error reporting generally.
	   Fixed error when creating multiple links between nodes in the editor (fozzy)
	   Docs update - More FAQs and config reference improvements/amendments.
	   Added 'Cycle' mode to plugin - automatically cycle between your weathermaps.
	   
0.8 -  Added ability to have multiple targets for a LINK - aggregate your T1s
       Added ability to use half an RRD (use '-' as the DS name) - if you have 'in' in one RRD, and 'out' in another
       Added a tab-seperated file datasource for TARGET lines, so you can draw anything you can dump into a textfile.
       Added ability to specify which corner of a NODE each LINK-end goes to - handy for busy hub nodes
       Added support for FreeType & GD fonts
       Added VIA points - a link can go around corners, and they're nicely curved too.
       Added gradient SCALEs - specify two colours for a band to have colours interpolated.
       Added many more colour controls for map elements:
		For Links: OUTLINECOLOR r g b ( or OUTLINECOLOR none)
		For Link bandwidth labels: BWOUTLINECOLOR, BWBOXCOLOR, BWFONTCOLOR
		For Nodes: LABELBGCOLOR, LABELFONTCOLOR, LABELOUTLINECOLOR, LABELFONTSHADOWCOLOR
		For Map 'furniture': TIMECOLOR, TITLECOLOR, KEYBGCOLOR, KEYTEXTCOLOR, KEYOUTLINE
       Added Cacti plugin. View and Manage UI, plus poller integration. No editor (yet)
       Updated example config to use new 0.8 features
       Re-organised manual, and heavily re-written config reference.
       Fixed cacti-pick.php some more (all done now?)
       Added non-bandwidth bandwidth labels: BWLABELS unformatted
	   Many Thanks to James Lang, Niels Baggesen and the [php-weathermap] mailing list for feedback
        during the testing of this release.

0.71 - Fixed database code in cacti-pick.php
       Fixed up editor to handle blank maps better.
       Fixed a problem with cached images in editor.

0.7 -	Updated the manual and example map to reflect all these changes.
	Added config options for HTMLOUTPUTFILE and IMAGEOUTPUTFILE. The
        idea is to reduce the size of command-lines, and make the map files
        more self-contained. CLI options still take precedence.
      Includes new 'DHTML' editor for the first time. This is still very much 
			  in testing - backup any map configs you edit with it first!
      Fixed DrawLegend() to not go below a minimum width (it used to use the 
			  title length, but that can be too small now)
      Added BACKGROUNDCOLOR option: take an R G B like the SCALE lines (request 
			  from kbriggs)
      Ripped out some of the 'live PHP' code to make DrawMap a bit simpler.
      Added a check for PNG support in CLI command.
      Added command-line error-checking (Niels is back again)
      Added a fix for Windows line-endings. Seems that PHP uses Unix-endings even on Win32
      Added LINK DEFAULT and NODE DEFAULT - set the defaults for (nearly) any 
	parameter. This also means that most node-affecting and link-affecting
	parameters are now per-node and per-link.
      Added ARROWSTYLE option - there's 'classic' and 'compact' with neater arrowheads.	
      Added LABELOFFSET option to change the relative position of the LABEL when an
        ICON is also used.
      Added OVERLIBWIDTH and OVERLIBHEIGHT to allow better OverLib output (Niels B, once more)
      Switched to using 24bit images internally. This should improve the handling of
        PNG transparency in ICONs.
      Improved number and content of error messages.
    
0.6 - Renamed weathermap.php to just 'weathermap' to make it more
      obviously not a PHP page.
      Fixed up NODE name regexp (thanks Niels Baggesen)
      Added warning for non-existent NODES in LINK (thanks again Niels Baggesen)
      HTML fix for <map> in generated HTML (Niels once more)
      More HTML fixes to make us a bit more XHTML-like.
      You can have an ICON and a LABEL now. LABEL is centred over the 
      NODE, for the moment. Also, there's a drop shadow effect, to make
      it easier to read the overlaid text.
      New config features: LINKFONT, NODEFONT and KEYFONT to control the
      fonts used for those things. It's a number from 1 to 5.
      Added BWLABELS NONE for no labels on links at all (request from Ueli Heuer)
      Moved responsibility for complete HTML page from the class to the CLI program - MakeHTML produces an HTML fragment now.
      Added ability to customise timestamp and legend text, by adding new text after the KEYPOS and TIMEPOS commands.

0.5a - Fixed totally embarrassing problems with the DS-specification code.
       As far as I can figure I never did test it. Oh dear. Thanks to 
       Jethro Binks for speedy patches.

0.5 - Fixed asymmetric BANDWIDTH bug - thanks rpingar
      Fix to make rrdtool commandline work on Windows - also thanks to rpingar
      Added specification of RRD DS names in TARGET ( blah.rrd:ds0:ds1 - that's in then out)
      Fix for different C libraries returning something other than NaN for a NaN (thru rrd) - now we look for good data rather than bad data.
      Allow for decimals in BANDWIDTH specifications - 1.5M should work now
      Allow for decimals in SCALE specifications - mainly useful for very small values on big links
      Brought back sub-1.0 percentages, which got lost somewhere along the line
      Added in warning for >100% lines 
      Added TIMEPOS option so *you* get to choose where the timestamp goes, mgb
      Fixed stupid bug in ReadRRDData - Weathermap should follow the data better now. Thanks to 'cl'

0.4 - Changed all internals to deal in bits/sec instead of bytes
      Moved timestamp back up to the top-right corner.
      *BREAKAGE* Changed BANDWIDTH to use bits too
      Added support for K,M,G,T suffixes on bandwidth specs
      Added KILO config file option to redefine 1K=1000 or 1K=1024 (or anything actually)
      Added --sizedebug commandline option, to help with figuring out
        what you did wrong with the new BANDWIDTH format. Shows max
        bandwidth instead of the current bandwidth on all links.
      Included something a bit more like a manual.
      *BREAKAGE* Changed BWLABELS options to be bits/percent, since they *are* bits!
      LABEL regexp relaxed to allow spaces in labels
      HTMLSTYLE, BWLABELS regexps tightened up to detect more errors
      Added new example config in docs/ directory
      Moved editor.php out of the way to random-bits
      Included a copy of auto-overlib.pl, just cos it's handy
      
0.3 - ICON config directive for NODEs added - same effect as jas0420's perl code
      Fixed WriteConfig a little - TITLEs are written. 
      OVERLIBGRAPH config is written for NODES.
      Fixed bug with OVERLIBGRAPH DHTML and NODEs
      Added --image-uri option back in from the perl version

0.2 - NODEs with no label aren't drawn but can still be an endpoint for a LINK.
      Small bugfixes from mgb
      Included the editor.php for people to see
      Code tidyup for weathermap.php

0.1 - Initial pre-release version
